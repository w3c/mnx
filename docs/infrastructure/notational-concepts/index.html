<h1>Notational concepts</h1>

<p>This page defines various notational terms used by this specification.</p>

<h2 id="metrical-position">Metrical position</h2>

<p>Most notated events possess a well-defined <em>metrical position</em>, giving a time onset expressed as a rational number of whole note durations after the start of its containing measure. This position may be thought of as the event’s "address" and plays a determining role in the normative rendering and performance of events.</p>

<h2 id="score-order">Score order and performance order</h2>

<p>Score order is the order in which measures are visually presented to a reader. This is distinct from performance order, which is the order in which the measures are played by a performer.</p>

<p>For example, score order and performance order would be different in the case of a repeat or "D.S. al Coda" jump.</p>

<h2 id="measure-content">Measure content</h2>

<p>Measure content supplies a sequence of &lt;measure&gt; elements, each of which supplies musical content for a time interval within a score.</p>

<p>The placement of the measures in measure content constitutes their <em>score order</em>, which is the order in which they are logically presented to a reader. This is distinct from their <em>performance order</em>, which is the order in which they are played by a performer.</p>
