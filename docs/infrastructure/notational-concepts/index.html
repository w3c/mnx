<h1>Notational concepts</h1>

<p>This page defines various notational terms used by this specification.</p>

<h2 id="metrical-position">Metrical position</h2>

<p>Most notated events possess a well-defined <em>metrical position</em>, giving a time onset expressed as a rational number of whole note durations after the start of its containing measure. This position may be thought of as the event’s "address" and plays a determining role in the normative rendering and performance of events.</p>

<h2 id="score-order">Score order and performance order</h2>

<p>Score order is the order in which measures are visually presented to a reader. This is distinct from performance order, which is the order in which the measures are played by a performer.</p>

<p>For example, score order and performance order would be different in the case of a repeat or "D.S. al Coda" jump.</p>

<h2 id="measure-content">Measure content</h2>

<p>Measure content supplies a sequence of &lt;measure&gt; elements, each of which supplies musical content for a time interval within a score.</p>

<p>The placement of the measures in measure content constitutes their <em>score order</em>, which is the order in which they are logically presented to a reader. This is distinct from their <em>performance order</em>, which is the order in which they are played by a performer.</p>

<h2 id="staff-directions">Staff directions</h2>

<p>Staff directions are directions that apply as a whole to the one or more musical staves in a part, and which determine the interpretation of other notations within some applicable range of those staves.</p>

<p>Because it delineates disjoint ranges of staves, any staff direction has the effect of <b>partitioning</b> the events in a measure, such that all events lie either before or after the given directions. For example, consider a clef element describing a clef change. No matter how many polyphonic voices exist in a measure, all notes in all voices either lie to the left or to the right of this clef.</p>

<p>For staff directions that modify the interpretation or layout of the staff, these directions apply from the start of that measure to all subsequent measures within the same &lt;global&gt; or &lt;part&gt; element until changed.</p>

<p>Most staff directions have a fixed location, typically the beginning or end of the measure in which they occur.</p>
