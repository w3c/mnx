# MNX

Welcome to MNX, the [W3C Music Notation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/music-notation/)'s next-generation music markup proposal.

The MNX standard is being developed here to be an extensible format and language specification, that can incorporate any kind of notated music used by web, desktop, and mobile applications.

Music notations include, but are not restricted to, _Common Western Music Notation_, which is the notation currently implemented by major vendors such as Finale, Dorico and capella,
and by many other commercial and non-commercial applications that use the MusicXML interchange format.

We are currently working on MNX-Common (a clean, modern successor to MusicXML) while isolating generalisable principles that can be used with non-CWMN notations.
Probably, MNX-Common will eventually have a set of hierarchically organised profiles, so that simpler applications will not have to deal with all levels of complexity.

MNX is independent of, but works closely with, two other [W3C Music Notation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/music-notation/) repositories:
- [https://github.com/w3c/musicxml](https://github.com/w3c/musicxml)
- [https://github.com/w3c/smufl](https://github.com/w3c/smufl)
