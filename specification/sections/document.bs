<h3 id="the-container-document">The container document</h3>

Each MNX document acts as a <dfn>container document</dfn>, which contains a
hierarchy of components which collectively make up the
document as a whole.

<!--
### A simple CWMN score

### A simple general score

### Compound MNX documents

It's also possible to combine different representations of music in the same
MNX document by using the <{collection}> element to combine  multiple chunks
of music into a single chunk.  Each chunk may possess a distinct encoding.
<{collection}> elements can be nested, allowing a subordinate collection to be 
embedded in a higher-level one.

Metadata elements such as <{identification}> or formatting elements like
<{style}> may be included at any level of the resulting structure, causing
them to apply them only to those parts of the document.

Here's an example that includes a hierarchy of collections and scores. (Note
that some of these could employ non-CWMN encodings as well.)
